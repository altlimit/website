        <h3 class="text-4xl">Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p class="py-4">ALTLIMIT values your privacy in your personal information and Content that you store or send in
            our
            Service.
            This Privacy Policy explains what information ALTLIMIT and its affiliated companies (together, “ALTLIMIT” or
            “we”
            and sometimes “us”)
            collect about you and why, what we may do with that information and how we handle your Content.</p>

        <h4 class="text-3xl">What Is The Scope Of This Privacy Policy?</h4>

        <p class="py-4">This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the ALTLIMIT Terms of Service and applies to the
            information obtained by
            us through your use of this website,
            the Service and other ALTLIMIT products and services, including the ALTLIMIT Market. Capitalized terms used
            in
            this Privacy Policy and not otherwise
            defined shall have the meanings provided for those terms in the Terms of Service.</p>

        <h4 class="text-3xl">Will This Privacy Policy Ever Change?</h4>

        <p class="py-4">As ALTLIMIT evolves, we may need to update this Policy to keep pace with changes in the Service,
            our business and laws applicable to us and you; we will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect
            your
            privacy.
            We will post any revisions to this Policy, along with their effective date, in an easy to find area of our
            web
            site, so we
            recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes. We will ask for your
            consent to
            such
            changes if required by applicable law; in other cases, please note that your continuation of your ALTLIMIT
            Service
            account
            after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy. If you
            disagree
            with any
            changes in this Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Policy, you will need
            to
            close your account.</p>
